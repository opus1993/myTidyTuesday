The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<p>Welcome. Most of the activity that I post here is related to the <a
href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">rfordatascience
#TidyTuesday</a> weekly social data project. The exercises are certainly
not finished products. They demonstrate what could be accomplished in an
hour or two after-hours, often from datasets that can be found out in
the “wild.” In many cases I’ve used these to explore packages with new
features and functions and to facilitate conversations with others in
the community via Twitter and Slack.</p>
