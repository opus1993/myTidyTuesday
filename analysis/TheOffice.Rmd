# Lasso Regression using Tidymodels Workflows and The Office TidyTuesday DataSet

Our starting point is [Julia Silge's Blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/lasso-the-office/), [David Robinson's screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IvAubTDQME&feature=youtu.be) and the [R4DS 2020 week 12 dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-17). Also, Jared Lander delivered [Many Ways To Lasso](https://jaredlander.com/content/2018/11/ManyWaysToLasso2.html#1) on a similar theme for the Chicago R User Group on 19 February, 2020. In this exercise, I will demonstrate how to build a LASSO regression model and choose regularization parameters.

## Get the data

The data this week comes from the `schrute` R package for **The Office** transcripts and `data.world` for *IMDB* ratings of each episode.

```{r}
# Get the Data
office_ratings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/office_ratings.csv')

```

## Explore the data

Our modeling goal here is to predict the IMDB ratings for episodes of **The Office** based on the other characteristics of the episodes in the `#TidyTuesday` dataset. There are two datasets, one with the ratings and one with information like director, writer, and which character spoke which line. The episode numbers and titles are not consistent between them, so we can use regular expressions to do a better job of matching the datasets up for joining.

```{r}
office_ratings %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, avg_rating))  +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9) +
  labs(title = "The Office",
       subtitle = "Average IMDB Rating",
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date()))

office_ratings %>%
  mutate(top_title = ifelse(imdb_rating >= 9.2 | imdb_rating <= 7,
                            title, ""),
         title = fct_inorder(title),
         episode_number = row_number()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(episode_number, imdb_rating)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.3, method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(season), size = total_votes)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = top_title, 
                y = if_else(imdb_rating > 8,
                              imdb_rating + 0.2,
                            imdb_rating - 0.2)), 
            check_overlap = TRUE, 
            hjust = 0.5) +
  expand_limits(x = -15 ) +
  labs(title = "Popularity of The Office episodes",
       subtitle = "IMDB Rating, Color by Season, Size by # of Ratings",
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date())) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Episode Number", y = "IMDB Rating")

```

```{r}
office_ratings %>%
  arrange(desc(imdb_rating)) %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(season, ".", episode, " ", title),
         title = fct_reorder(title, imdb_rating)) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(title, imdb_rating, color = factor(season), size = total_votes)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(color = "Season",
       title = "Most Popular Episodes of The Office",
       subtitle = "Top 20 Season.Episode Titles, Color by Season and Size by Total Votes", caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date())) 


```

To merge the datasets on episode, we have to clean the ratings file field by removing punctuation, digits, the words "part" and "parts", and make all text lower case. Even after cleaning, three episode titles have to be manually imputed with a case_when statement to successfully join every episode rating with the text of the episode.

```{r}
remove_regex <- "[:punct:]|[:digit:]|parts |part |the |and"

office_ratings <- office_ratings %>%
  transmute(
    episode_name = str_to_lower(title),
    episode_name = str_remove_all(episode_name, remove_regex),
    episode_name = str_trim(episode_name),
    imdb_rating
  )

office_ratings <- office_ratings %>%
  mutate(episode_name = case_when(
    episode_name == "email surveillance" ~ "email surveilance",
    episode_name == "coverup" ~ "cover",
    episode_name == "sex ed" ~ "sx ed",
    TRUE ~ episode_name))

office_info <- schrute::theoffice %>%
  mutate(
    season = as.numeric(season),
    episode = as.numeric(episode),
    episode_name = str_to_lower(episode_name),
    episode_name = str_remove_all(episode_name, remove_regex),
    episode_name = str_trim(episode_name)
  ) %>%
  select(season, episode, episode_name, director, writer, character)

```

Lets explore words that individual characters say, that other characters do not, that are most indicative of that person.

In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. tf–idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today.

```{r}
office_transcripts <- as_tibble(schrute::theoffice)

blacklist <- c("yeah", "hey", "uh", "gonna", "lot", "ah", "huh", "hmm", "um", "ha", "na", "no", "nah", "ahh")
blacklist_character <- c("Group", "Everyone", "All")

transcript_words <- office_transcripts %>%
  group_by(character) %>%
  filter(n() >= 100,
         n_distinct(episode_name) > 2) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-text_w_direction) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(!word %in% blacklist,
         !character %in% blacklist_character)

character_tf_idf <- transcript_words %>%
  add_count(word) %>%
  filter(n > 20) %>%
  count(word, character) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, character, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```

Let's explore the content of Dwight's and Jim's lines. What words are most characteristic, or specific, to the character, with a high term frequency and low overall IDF. 

```{r}
character_tf_idf %>%
  filter(character == "Dwight") %>%
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "Dwight's Lines in The Office",
       subtitle = "Highest Tf-IDF words", 
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date())) 

character_tf_idf %>%
  filter(character == "Jim") %>%
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "Jim's Lines in The Office",
       subtitle = "Highest Tf-IDF words", 
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date())) 


character_tf_idf %>%
  filter(character %in% c("Jim","Dwight","Michael","Meredith")) %>%
  group_by(character) %>%
  top_n(10, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, character)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = character)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +  
  scale_x_reordered() +
  facet_wrap(~ character, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Character Lines in The Office",
       subtitle = "Words most specific to a character", 
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date()),
       x = "", y = "TF-IDF of character-word pairs") 
```

We are going to use several different kinds of features for modeling. Let’s find out how many times characters speak per episode.

```{r}
characters <- office_info %>%
  count(episode_name, character) %>%
  add_count(character, wt = n, name = "character_count") %>%
  filter(character_count > 800) %>%
  select(-character_count) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = character,
    values_from = n,
    values_fill = list(n = 0)
  )
```

And, let’s find which directors and writers are involved in each episode. I’m choosing here to combine this into one category in modeling, for a simpler model, since these are often the same individuals. And we will only model on creators that were involved in at least 15 distinct episodes.

```{r}
creators <- office_info %>%
  distinct(episode_name, director, writer) %>%
  pivot_longer(director:writer, names_to = "role", values_to = "person") %>%
  separate_rows(person, sep = ";") %>%
  add_count(person) %>%
  filter(n > 15) %>%
  distinct(episode_name, person) %>%
  mutate(person_value = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = person,
    values_from = person_value,
    values_fill = list(person_value = 0)
  )
```

Next, let’s find the season and episode number for each episode, and then finally put it all together into one dataset for modeling.

```{r}
office <- office_info %>%
  distinct(season, episode, episode_name) %>%
  inner_join(characters) %>%
  inner_join(creators) %>%
  inner_join(office_ratings %>%
               select(episode_name, imdb_rating)) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

```

One more quick peek into the dataset. This time, across all seasons, do the ratings of the episodes follow a pattern through the course of the season? Ratings appear to be higher for episodes later in the season. What else is associated with higher ratings? Let’s use LASSO regression to find out!

```{r}
office %>%
  ggplot(aes(episode, 
             imdb_rating, 
             fill = as.factor(episode))) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:28) +
  labs(title = "The Office Ratings",
       subtitle = "IMDB, by episode, across all seasons", 
       caption = paste0("Jim Gruman ", Sys.Date()),
       x = NULL, y = "IMDB Rating") 

```

## Train a Model

We can start by splitting our data into training and testing sets.

```{r}
office_split <- initial_split(office, strata = season)
office_train <- training(office_split)
office_test <- testing(office_split)
```
Then, we build a recipe for data preprocessing.

First, we must tell the `recipe()` what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what our training data is.

Next, we update the role for `episode_name`, since this is a variable we might like to keep around for convenience as an identifier for rows but is not a predictor or outcome.

Next, we remove any numeric variables that have zero variance.

As a last step, we normalize (center and scale) the numeric variables. We need to do this because it’s important for LASSO regularization.

The object `office_rec` is a recipe that has not been trained on data yet (for example, the centered and scaling has not been calculated) and office_prep is an object that has been trained on data. The reason I use strings_as_factors = FALSE here is that my ID column episode_name is of type character (as opposed to, say, integers).

```{r}
office_rec <- recipe(imdb_rating ~ ., data = office_train) %>%
  update_role(episode_name, new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())

office_prep <- office_rec %>%
  prep(strings_as_factors = FALSE) # the episode ID column remains a string
```

Now it’s time to specify and then fit our models. Here I set up one model specification for LASSO regression; I picked a value for penalty (sort of randomly) and I set `mixture = 1` for LASSO. I am using a `workflow()` in this example for convenience; these are objects that can help you manage modeling pipelines more easily, with pieces that fit together like Lego blocks. You can `fit()` a workflow, much like you can fit a model.

```{r}
lasso_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = 0.1, mixture = 1) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(office_rec)

lasso_fit <- wf %>%
  add_model(lasso_spec) %>%
  fit(data = office_train)

```

If you have used `glmnet` before, this is the familiar output where we can see (here, for the most regularized examples) the features that contribute to higher IMDB ratings.

## Tune LASSO parameters

So we managed to fit one LASSO model, but how do we know the right regularization parameter penalty? We can figure that out using resampling and tuning the model. Let’s build a set of bootstrap resamples, and set `penalty = tune()` instead of to a single value. We can use a function `penalty()` to set up an appropriate grid for this kind of regularization model.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
office_boot <- bootstraps(office_train, strata = season)

tune_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 1) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

lambda_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(), levels = 40)
```
Now it’s time to tune the grid, using our workflow object.

```{r}
all_cores <- parallelly::availableCores(omit = 1)
all_cores

future::plan("multisession", workers = all_cores) # on Windows

set.seed(42)
lasso_grid <- tune_grid(
  wf %>% add_model(tune_spec),
  resamples = office_boot,
  grid = lambda_grid
)
```

Let's take a look at a visualization of performance with the regularization parameter.

```{r}
lasso_grid %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  ggplot(aes(penalty, mean, color = .metric)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(
    ymin = mean - std_err,
    ymax = mean + std_err
  ),
  alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  facet_wrap(~.metric, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This is a great way to see that regularization helps this modeling a lot. We have a couple of options for choosing our final parameter, such as `select_by_pct_loss()` or `select_by_one_std_err()`, but for now let’s stick with just picking the lowest RMSE. After we have that parameter, we can finalize our workflow, i.e. update it with this value.

```{r}
lowest_rmse <- lasso_grid %>%
  select_best("rmse")

final_lasso <- finalize_workflow(
  wf %>% add_model(tune_spec),
  lowest_rmse
)

final_lasso
```

The optimal penalty is shown here as 0.0289

We can then fit this finalized workflow on our training data. While we’re at it, let’s see what the most important variables are using the `vip` package.

```{r}
final_lasso %>%
  fit(office_train) %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  vip::vi(lambda = lowest_rmse$penalty) %>%
  mutate(
    Importance = abs(Importance),
    Variable = fct_reorder(Variable, Importance)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Importance, y = Variable, fill = Sign)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(y = NULL)
```

Clearly, the features with the greatest importance in predicting IMDB rating include the presence of Greg Daniels, Michael, the episode itself, B J Novak, and Jan.

And then, finally, let’s return to our test data. The `tune` package has a function `last_fit()` which is nice for situations when you have tuned and finalized a model or workflow and want to fit it one last time on your training data and evaluate it on your testing data. You only have to pass this function your finalized model/workflow and your split.

```{r}
last_fit(
  final_lasso,
  office_split
) %>%
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
