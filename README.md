# my TidyTuesday website collection

Welcome. Most of the activity that I post here is related to the rfordatascience #TidyTuesday weekly social data project. The exercises are certainly not finished products. They demonstrate what could be accomplished in an hour or two after-hours, often from datasets that can be found out in the “wild.” In many cases I’ve used these to explore packages with new features and functions and to facilitate conversations with others in the community via Twitter and Slack.

This personal website is a github page at https://opus1993.github.io/myTidyTuesday/

The menus lead to detailed "about" and "license" sections.
